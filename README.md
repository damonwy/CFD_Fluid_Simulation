Project 1: Building an advector
Implement semi-lagrangian advection for advecting both density and color. Also implement a bouyant gravity force using the density field. Use the keys g and G to control the value of the gravity constant. Use the keys q and Q to control the size of the time step. This project will allow the user to (a) load a background image, and (b) paint density into the scene. The bouyancy on the density will induce a non-zero velocity, which in turn will cause the density and the color to advect.

Project 2: Incompressibility & IOP
Building onto project 1, implement Gauss-Seidel iteration for computing incompressibility. Also implement boundary conditions and Iterated Orthognal Projections. Startup inputs, the number of iterations of GS desired, and the number of iterations of IOP included. Paint obstruction that acts as a boundary on the flow. (Extra: paint divergence)
